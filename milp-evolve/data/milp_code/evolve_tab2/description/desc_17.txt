This optimization problem focuses on placing electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across a network to maximize accessibility while managing land and operational costs. 
The network is represented as a graph where nodes represent potential station locations, and edges represent connectivity, such as road access between locations. 
Each node has associated costs, zoning compatibility, energy limits, and operational capacity constraints. 
Binary variables determine if a station is placed at a node, with constraints ensuring that each station meets minimum operational capacity, is within energy limits, and follows zoning rules. 
The objective function aims to maximize station accessibility (weighted by connectivity) while minimizing land costs and penalizing underutilized stations by including the difference between maximum and actual station capacity. 
This setup helps plan an efficient, accessible, and cost-effective EV charging network.
