The k-median problem aims to minimize the total weighted travel cost for servicing a group of customers from exactly k facilities. 
In this setup, each customer must be assigned to one of the k chosen facilities, with the travel cost between a customer and a facility often represented by Euclidean distance. 
The decision-making involves selecting which k facilities to open out of a larger set of potential locations, while ensuring that customers are assigned in a way that reduces the overall travel costs. 
Constraints are set up so each customer is assigned to only one open facility, and only k facilities are opened. 
The optimal solution identifies which specific facilities minimize the weighted sum of distances across all customer-to-facility assignments, 
making it useful for real-world applications in logistics and resource distribution.
