This optimization model involves assigning colors to nodes in a graph while considering additional spatial and resource constraints. 
Nodes represent locations that can be used for certain resources, each with specific land costs, zoning compatibility, and energy availability. 
The model uses graph coloring constraints, ensuring adjacent nodes have different colors, 
and limits the number of colors assigned. A set of binary variables determines if each node is in use, adding flexibility in land use and allowing the inclusion of zoning and energy availability constraints.
Additionally, grid substations influence the objective function by offering bonuses for using nodes with established energy access. 
The objective seeks to minimize the total cost by penalizing excessive color usage (representing resource allocation diversity) and high land use costs while maximizing the utility from using nodes near grid substations. 
This model is well-suited for applications in resource planning and spatial optimization within a graph structure, particularly under budget constraints and regulatory conditions.
