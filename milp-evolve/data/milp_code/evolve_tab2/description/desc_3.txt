In this graph coloring optimization problem, the goal is to assign colors to nodes in a graph so that no two connected nodes (nodes with an edge between them) share the same color, 
while also minimizing the total number of colors used. Think of each color as a resource, like time slots in a scheduling problem, 
where each node represents an event that cannot overlap with its connected events. 
The model assigns colors to nodes with constraints that ensure each node has one color, 
and connected nodes have different colors. By minimizing the number of colors, 
the problem finds the most efficient way to color the graph without conflicts, 
a solution approach useful in real-world scenarios like scheduling tasks or designing wireless networks where interference needs to be minimized.
