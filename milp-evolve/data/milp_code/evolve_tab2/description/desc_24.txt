This Job Scheduling optimization model seeks to assign a set of jobs to a limited number of machines while respecting job processing times, 
inter-job precedence constraints, and machine-specific costs. Each job requires a start and completion time on its assigned machine, 
with sequencing constraints ensuring that jobs sharing a machine do not overlap. 
The model incorporates both intra-group precedence (jobs in a group must follow a set sequence) and randomly generated inter-group precedence constraints. 
The primary objective is to minimize a combined measure of the overall makespan (the time by which all jobs are completed) and the total machine assignment cost. 
By optimizing both time and cost, the model balances efficiency in job completion with resource allocation expenses.
