This model tackles a robust job scheduling problem where jobs must be assigned to machines, 
respecting precedence and timing constraints, while also accounting for uncertainty in processing times and tariff impacts. 
Each job has a stochastic processing time based on a mean and variance, and tariff impacts introduce additional risk-related costs, 
scaled by a risk weight parameter. The model enforces precedence constraints within dynamically generated job groups and ensures that jobs assigned to the same machine are properly sequenced to avoid overlap. 
A large constant M is used to impose these sequencing constraints on binary variables indicating the job order. 
The objective is to minimize the makespan (total schedule duration) and total risk cost. 
The model includes flexibility for randomness, precedence grouping, and the assignment of jobs to machines, aiming for an optimal job schedule under uncertainty.
