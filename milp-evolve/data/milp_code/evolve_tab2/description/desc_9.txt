This robust bin packing optimization problem focuses on assigning items to bins with constraints on capacity, 
incorporating margins to account for uncertainty. Each item has a certain size and value, 
and each bin has a capacity with a possible fluctuation range, which reflects real-life variations like measurement errors 
or unexpected changes in capacity. The goal is to pack the items to maximize the total value of items in the bins, 
while ensuring that the sum of item sizes in each bin stays within its adjusted capacity. 
The model uses binary decision variables to indicate whether an item is included in a bin, 
and constraints ensure that each binâ€™s capacity is not exceeded, even under the worst-case fluctuation scenario. 
This approach is useful in resource allocation problems where capacities or demands are uncertain.
