This loyalty rewards optimization model assigns membership rewards to maximize benefits within regional constraints, 
incorporating a robust approach to account for variability in resource consumption. 
Each region has a maximum capacity for rewards, and each member has an associated benefit weight. 
Randomly generated variations, modeled as a delta factor, represent uncertainties in resource usage for each region-member pairing. 
Binary decision variables determine whether a member receives a reward, and constraints ensure that the total resources used (adjusted for variability) do not exceed each regionâ€™s limit. 
The objective is to maximize the total benefit across all regions by rewarding the most valuable members while staying within capacity limits. 
This setup helps organizations manage loyalty programs efficiently, particularly when there is uncertainty in resource demand.
