This optimization model tackles the classic graph coloring problem, where each node in a graph must be assigned a color such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color, 
using the minimum possible number of colors. To enforce that neighboring nodes in identified cliques (subsets of fully connected nodes) use distinct colors, 
constraints limit color overlap within each clique. Additionally, the model incorporates a Big M constraint formulation for connected subgraphs to handle hierarchical color dependencies, 
which penalize extensive color sharing across the same subgraph. 
The objective function minimizes the total number of colors used while meeting both node and subgraph color constraints, 
making this a robust and resource-efficient approach for coloring large and complex graphs.
