## Responsible AI Considerations  

The integration of GenAI into decision intelligence and optimization has provided human-like reasoning in complex problem-solving. However, it is essential to actively consider the ethical and responsible aspects of AI to ensure its application remains both beneficial and free from unintended consequences.  

Since we utilize publicly available language models, our framework inherently inherits both the strengths and limitations of these models. Recognizing these challenges, we have implemented safeguard mechanisms to ensure fairness, robustness, and safety in decision-making. Nevertheless, due to the inherent complexities of AI, issues such as model biases, adversarial vulnerabilities, and unexpected behaviors can still arise.  

Researchers and practitioners must critically assess and interpret these AI-driven solutions, maintaining a deep understanding of both the advantages and limitations of LLMs. By responsibly leveraging these models, we can drive significant advancements in decision intelligence and optimization while upholding ethical standards and mitigating potential risks.

## Prohibitions
Due to the specialized nature of this repository, which includes both benchmark data and source code designed for evaluating data-oriented models and pipelines, we expressly prohibit the following:

1. Scraping the content of this repository for the purpose of training machine learning models, deep learning architectures, data science algorithms, large language models, or any other data-driven computational models.  Utilizing this repository's content for such purposes could introduce bias and invalidate the evaluation metrics of the trained models. You are, however, permitted to use this repository for the evaluation of models and pipelines.
2. Violating the licensing terms in this repository.
