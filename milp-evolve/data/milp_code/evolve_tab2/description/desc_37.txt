This optimization model simulates the process of protein folding by determining the optimal way to fold a sequence of amino acids, 
considering interactions between hydrophobic (H-phobic) and hydrophilic components. 
The model represents the amino acids as nodes in a graph, where the edges signify possible interactions, 
generated using a Barab√°si-Albert graph structure to simulate a realistic network of amino acids. 
Hydrophobic amino acids are randomly assigned based on a specified ratio, and the goal is to identify pairwise matchings and folds that optimize structural stability. 
Binary decision variables track matches between H-phobic acids, individual folds at each acid, and adjacency-based folding constraints. 
Constraints ensure that folds are placed only where permitted by adjacency and sequence rules, as well as restrictions on matches involving intermediary acids. 
The objective function maximizes the number of favorable hydrophobic contacts while incorporating adjacency-based stability factors, 
thus reflecting the natural tendency of proteins to achieve low-energy, stable conformations. 
This model is applicable in structural biology and protein engineering, where understanding protein folding patterns is essential.
