This model addresses the graph coloring problem, aiming to assign colors to nodes in a graph such that adjacent nodes have different colors and the total number of colors used is minimized. 
Nodes within each clique are constrained to have different colors, with additional logical conditions imposed on connected subgraphs to control color dependencies. 
Specifically, each subgraph must satisfy a color assignment threshold to avoid exceeding a predefined dependency. 
The model uses binary variables for each node-color pair, ensuring each node is assigned a single color,
 and introduces auxiliary binary variables for each color in each subgraph to enforce the logical constraints. 
 The objective function minimizes the total number of colors used while maintaining the color constraints and logical dependencies across subgraphs.
