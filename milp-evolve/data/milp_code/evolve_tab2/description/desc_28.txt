This model focuses on optimizing the placement and phased deployment of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across a graph-represented network. 
Each potential station site (node) is evaluated based on land costs, energy availability, zoning compatibility, and tariff impacts, with connections between nodes representing possible network benefits. 
Placement decisions involve constraints on energy resources and land use compatibility. 
The model includes deployment timing variables to enforce a phased installation sequence, ensuring stations are deployed in a specified order. 
The objective function seeks to maximize network accessibility—enhancing connections while considering node-specific weights—while minimizing associated land costs and tariff impacts. 
By accounting for setup costs, regional resource limits, and sequential deployment, the model provides a strategy for an efficient, cost-effective expansion of EV charging infrastructure.
