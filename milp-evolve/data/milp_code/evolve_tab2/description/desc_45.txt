This optimization model is designed to determine optimal locations for placing electric vehicle (EV) charging stations on a network, 
represented by a graph with nodes and edges. Each node in the graph represents a potential station location, 
while edges denote connectivity between nodes. The model incorporates various parameters, such as land costs, setup costs, energy availability, 
and a budget limit for installation. It seeks to maximize the overall network accessibility by encouraging station placement on nodes that enhance connectivity (reflected in edge weights) 
and predicted benefits of specific locations. Constraints ensure that each stationâ€™s energy demand does not exceed local availability and that setup costs do not exceed the available budget. 
Additionally, nodes have constraints on minimum and maximum operational capacities. 
The objective function optimizes both connectivity and predicted station benefits, resulting in an efficient station placement plan that adheres to energy and budget constraints.
