This Loyalty Rewards optimization model is designed to maximize the total benefits from rewarding members within different regional capacity limits. 
Each member has a benefit weight, and each region has a resource limit. The model assigns rewards to members (represented by binary decision variables) such that the total rewards given in each region do not exceed its limit. 
The objective function maximizes the sum of benefits across all members rewarded. 
To reduce redundant solutions, symmetry-breaking constraints are added for members with similar benefit weights, 
limiting the number of rewards that can be assigned to members of equal weight. 
This addition streamlines the optimization, making it more efficient by reducing the number of symmetric solutions explored.
