The max cut optimization problem involves dividing the nodes of a graph into two groups to maximize the sum of weights on edges 
that have one endpoint in each group. Imagine you have a network where nodes are connected by weighted edges, 
and you want to split the nodes into two sets so that the "cut" between them (the edges connecting nodes in different sets) 
has the highest possible total weight. In this code, a graph is generated with random weights on edges, 
and a binary variable is assigned to each node to indicate its group. Constraints are added to ensure each edge either 
connects nodes in the same set or across sets. The objective function then maximizes the weight of edges across the cut, 
solving the problem using optimization techniques. This approach is useful in network design, 
where maximizing the separation or load between two groups is desired.
