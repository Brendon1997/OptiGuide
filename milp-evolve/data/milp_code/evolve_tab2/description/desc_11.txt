This graph coloring optimization problem aims to color the nodes of a graph so that no two adjacent nodes share the same color, 
while minimizing the total number of colors used. 
To further restrict the coloring, maximal cliques (fully connected subgraphs) within the graph are identified. 
Nodes within each clique must all have different colors, adding a layer of complexity to the constraints. 
Binary variables represent the assignment of colors to each node, and additional variables track whether each color is used. 
The model enforces constraints to ensure that each node is assigned one color and that nodes in cliques do not share colors. 
The objective is to minimize the number of colors needed, making this problem useful in applications like scheduling, 
where minimizing conflicts between tasks (nodes) that depend on shared resources is essential.
