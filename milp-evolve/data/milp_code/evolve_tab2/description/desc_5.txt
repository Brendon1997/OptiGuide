The job shop scheduling problem involves assigning jobs to machines, 
with each job requiring a specific machine and processing time, often in a particular sequence. 
The objective is to minimize the "makespan"â€”the total time to finish all jobs. 
Constraints ensure that jobs follow their required order and that jobs sharing a machine do not overlap.
The model uses start and completion times for each job and binary variables to determine job order on shared machines, 
making this approach valuable in manufacturing and operations to optimize scheduling and meet deadlines efficiently.
