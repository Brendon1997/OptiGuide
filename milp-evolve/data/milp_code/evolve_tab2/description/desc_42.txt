This optimization model is designed to assign colors to nodes within a graph while minimizing associated costs, such as land use and tariff impacts, and meeting multiple constraints. 
It assigns nodes specific colors while ensuring that adjacent nodes have different colors to avoid conflicts. 
Additionally, the model integrates real-world factors: each node has zoning compatibility, energy availability, and land costs, which contribute to the objective. 
Nodes may also incur tariff impacts, which are proportional to their usage in the network. 
Sequential deployment constraints enforce a specific order for node utilization, while penalty costs for the number of colors used and energy demands are incorporated into the objective. 
The primary goal is to minimize total cost by balancing the use of colors, land, and energy resources, while maximizing tariff efficiency and adherence to deployment scheduling.
