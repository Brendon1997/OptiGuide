This optimization model tackles the assignment of vessels to ports, 
balancing port capacity constraints, handling costs, and overtime costs. 
Each vessel has a set processing time and must be assigned to exactly one port. 
Each port has limited berthing capacity and incurs specific handling and overtime costs. 
To account for operational uncertainties, the model incorporates variability in vessel processing times, 
which can increase demand on port capacity. 
A binary decision variable determines whether each vessel is assigned to a specific port, 
and a continuous variable tracks overtime usage at each port. 
The objective function minimizes the total cost, combining handling and overtime expenses, 
thus optimizing port assignments while ensuring cost efficiency and reliability. 
This setup is applicable to logistical operations in port management, supporting effective vessel-port assignments under uncertain conditions.
