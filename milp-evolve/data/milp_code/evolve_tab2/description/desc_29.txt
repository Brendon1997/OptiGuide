This job scheduling model optimizes the assignment and ordering of jobs on machines, considering both precedence and capacity constraints. 
Each job has a random processing time and may have precedence constraints with other jobs. 
Jobs are assigned to specific machines, with auxiliary allocation variables indicating whether jobs can exceed standard machine capacities at an added cost. 
The model also considers tariff impacts by assigning a risk cost to each job, which depends on trade tariffs and job duration. Using a large constant (M) for sequencing, 
the model enforces job ordering on the same machine to avoid overlap. 
The objective is to minimize a combination of the makespan (total completion time), the total risk cost, and an additional penalty for auxiliary allocations. 
This approach balances job completion efficiency, machine capacity, and risk costs, providing a strategic scheduling solution under varying operational constraints.
