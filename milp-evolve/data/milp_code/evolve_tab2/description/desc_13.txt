The vessel-port assignment optimization problem assigns vessels to ports while minimizing handling and overtime costs. 
Each vessel requires a specific processing time, and each port has limited berthing capacity and a per-hour overtime cost if capacity is exceeded. 
Binary decision variables are used to determine which port each vessel is assigned to, with constraints ensuring each vessel is assigned to exactly one port. 
Additionally, constraints allow overtime when total processing time at a port exceeds its capacity, adding a cost for each hour of overtime. 
The objective function minimizes the combined handling and overtime costs across all ports, providing an efficient allocation strategy that optimizes costs for docking multiple vessels at limited-capacity ports.
