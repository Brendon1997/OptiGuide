This optimization model is designed to identify optimal locations for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations within a given network of potential nodes. 
The model operates on a graph structure representing the network, where each node signifies a potential station location and each edge denotes connectivity between locations. 
It considers various factors, such as land costs, energy availability, zoning compatibility, grid substations, and tariff impacts. 
Each node has binary decision variables indicating station placement, resource allocation, and compliance with zoning regulations. 
The objective function seeks to maximize connectivity and substation resources while minimizing land costs and tariff impacts. 
Additional constraints ensure that energy demands do not exceed availability, and a priority variable with a large constant (Big M) term enforces priority constraints for specific nodes. 
The model's outcome identifies a balanced solution for station deployment that maximizes network accessibility and minimizes operational costs, while meeting regulatory and resource limitations.
