This protein folding optimization problem models how a protein, represented by a chain of amino acids, 
can fold in a way that maximizes favorable interactions among hydrophobic (water-repelling) amino acids.
The chain contains both hydrophobic and hydrophilic (water-attracting) amino acids. 
Due to natural folding tendencies, hydrophobic amino acids tend to cluster together, minimizing their exposure to water. 
The goal here is to select specific fold points in the chain to bring as many non-contiguous pairs of hydrophobic amino acids close enough to match, 
meaning they can interact without being directly next to each other. 
To achieve this, the model uses binary variables to represent both potential pairwise matches between hydrophobic amino acids 
and the locations of folds in the chain. Constraints ensure that matched pairs are non-contiguous, have an even spacing between them, 
and are separated by exactly one fold. The objective is to maximize the total number of these favorable hydrophobic matches, 
providing a folding pattern that aligns with the protein's natural structure formation.
