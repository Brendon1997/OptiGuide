Any advice?\nAssistant: First, analyze the model log file for any clues on which constraints might be causing the issue.\nUser: The log just states it's infeasible without specifics.\nAssistant: Use Gurobi's Irreducible Inconsistent Subsystem (IIS) feature. After solving, call `model.computeIIS()` to identify the smallest subset of constraints that are infeasible.\nUser: What if the IIS is too complex?\nAssistant: Try relaxing some of the constraints in the IIS or use the feasibility relaxation tool to identify the critical constraints causing infeasibility.\nUser: Any other suggestions?\nAssistant: Double-check your input data for errors and incrementally simplify your model by removing constraints to isolate the infeasibility source.\nUser: Thanks, I'll try these steps.\nAssistant: No problem, let me know how it goes. Debugging MIP models can be challenging, but these steps should help."
