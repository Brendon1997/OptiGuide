This optimization model simulates the protein folding process, considering various biochemical and risk factors. 
The protein structure is represented by a graph where nodes are amino acids, and edges indicate possible bonds.
Some amino acids are hydrophobic, and the model seeks to bring these closer together to stabilize the protein. 
Folding decisions are affected by an adjacency matrix representing the spatial connectivity of amino acids. 
Tariff impacts add a risk component to the folding, introducing penalties for costly foldings. 
Additionally, the model incorporates sequence constraints, ensuring that some amino acids must fold in a specific order. 
Key variables include binary fold indicators, matching indicators for hydrophobic pairs, adjacency-based fold indicators, and risk costs based on fold locations and tariff impacts.
The objective is to maximize fold stability by optimizing matches, adjacency folds, and sequence constraints while minimizing risk-induced costs. 
This approach allows the model to predict stable folding configurations that also consider external risk factors, enhancing the proteinâ€™s structural robustness.
