This optimization problem combines graph coloring and network flow. It starts by coloring the nodes of a graph, 
ensuring that no two adjacent nodes share the same color, while minimizing the number of colors used. 
This is represented by assigning a color to each node and setting constraints so that connected nodes (edges) 
cannot have the same color. Additionally, the model introduces a network flow component. 
Each edge in the graph has a flow capacity, and a flow is sent from a defined source node to a sink node. 
Flow conservation constraints ensure that the flow into each intermediate node equals the flow out, 
while the source pushes flow into the network, and the sink absorbs it. 
The optimization objective is to minimize the total number of colors used while respecting the flow capacities, 
making this approach valuable for problems where resource management and conflict minimization are needed simultaneously.
