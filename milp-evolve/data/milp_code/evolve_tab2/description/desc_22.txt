This graph coloring optimization problem assigns colors to nodes in a randomly generated graph such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color, 
with the goal of minimizing the total number of colors used. 
The model leverages maximal cliques (fully connected subgroups within the graph) to enforce that nodes in each clique have different colors, 
which strengthens the constraint by focusing on densely connected regions. 
A symmetry-breaking constraint is introduced by enforcing that the first node uses the first color, 
helping reduce redundant solutions. Binary decision variables determine if a particular color is assigned to a node, 
and constraints ensure each node has exactly one color. 
The objective function minimizes the number of colors required, making this model useful for resource allocation, scheduling, or other applications where distinct groups must avoid conflicts, such as frequency assignments in wireless networks.
