The bin packing problem involves assigning a set of items, each with a specific size, into a limited number of bins, 
where each bin has a maximum capacity. The objective is typically to minimize the number of bins used, 
or to maximize the value of items packed into these bins without exceeding their capacities.
Here, each item is represented by a binary variable indicating whether it is packed into a particular bin or not. 
Constraints ensure that the sum of item sizes in each bin does not exceed the binâ€™s capacity. 
Bin packing is widely applicable in logistics, resource allocation, and memory storage, where efficient space utilization is crucial.
