This optimization model is designed to determine the optimal placement of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations within a region represented as a graph, 
where nodes are potential station locations and edges represent connections between them. 
Each node has specific attributes, including land costs, energy availability, zoning compatibility, 
and predicted benefits from station placement. The model also considers operational constraints such as minimum and maximum capacities for each station, 
as well as a total setup budget constraint. Decision variables include binary indicators for station placement at each node, 
with additional variables for meeting minimum operational capacity and adjacency requirements. 
The objective function maximizes accessibility and benefits by balancing predicted benefits and adjacency while minimizing costs associated with land, operational capacity shortfall, and the station setup budget. 
This model provides an optimized approach for EV infrastructure development by addressing economic and resource constraints.
